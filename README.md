# Wallflower.Atto Server

The Wallflower.Atto server implements a simple HTTP API for storing and retrieving data points (timestamped integers, floats, and strings) and includes a JS/jQuery web interface. The server is written in Python and the HTTP API is built upon a Flask app. By modifying the wallflower_config.json file, the server can be set to use a PostgreSQL or SQLite database for storage. We have elected to leave the API exposed in the server, demo, and interface code to enable easy modification and experimentation.

### Quick Start Guide

Wallflower.Atto requires Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy, which can be installed with pip
```sh
$ pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy
```
To start the server on your computer, run
```sh
$ python wallflower_atto_server.py
```
Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the interactive dashboard. By default, the server will also be publicly available on your network and accessible via the IP address of your computer (i.e. http://IP_ADDRESS:5000/).

The wallflower_demo.py file includes sample Python code for creating objects and streams and for sending new data points. The Wallflower.Atto server is still in beta development, so if you find a bug, please let us know.

### Deploying to Heroku

The Wallflower.Atto server can be deployed to the Heroku cloud application platform with the following steps.

##### Create Accounts
- Setup a [Heroku] account. It's free. 
- Setup a [Cloud9] account. It's free. We will use Cloud9 to edit and deploy the app.

##### Clone The App
 - Create a new workspace on Cloud9 (c9.io) and use the Python template. This will take a minute as Cloud9 creates a virtual machine.
 - Use the console at the bottom of the page to clone the app into your workspace.
 - Note: Only enter the text that comes after $.
 - Note: /wallflower-atto $ means you must run the command from the wallflower-atto directory.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/wallflowercc/wallflower-atto
```
 - You now have your own copy of the Wallflower.Atto server which you can edit from the Cloud9 workspace. Edit the wallflower_config.json file to select the Heroku  PostgreSQL database type by changing

 ```sh
 "type": "sqlite",
 ```
 to
 ```sh
 "type": "postgresql-heroku",
 ```
 
##### Connect To Heroku
 - Next we will login to Heroku from Cloud9.
```sh
$ heroku login
```

##### Create a New Heroku App with a PostreSQL Database
```sh
$ cd wallflower-atto/
/wallflower-atto $ heroku create
/wallflower-atto $ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

##### Update the Git Repository
```sh
/wallflower-atto $ git add --all
/wallflower-atto $ git commit -m "Initial Save"
```

##### Push the App to Heroku
```sh
/wallflower-atto $ git push heroku master
/wallflower-atto $ heroku ps:scale web=1
```
 - That is it. The Wallflower.Atto server is now running on Heroku. Below are a few more notes. 
 
##### Run the Wallflower.Atto server on Cloud9
 - Install the necessary Python modules on the Cloud9 workspace.
```sh
$ sudo pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy gunicorn psycopg2
```
 - To run the app from Cloud9, login to Heroku from the Cloud9 console and run
```sh
/wallflower-atto $ DATABASE_URL=$(heroku config:get DATABASE_URL) heroku local
```
 - The app will be running at https://WORKSPACE-USERNAME.c9users.io/ where WORKSPACE is the name of your workspace and USERNAME is your Cloud9 username. Use CTRL+C to close the app.
 
 
##### Saving Changes and Pushing to Heroku
 - After making changes to your app, enter these commands to push the changes to Heroku.
```sh
$ cd wallflower-atto/
/wallflower-atto $ git add --all
/wallflower-atto $ git commit -m "Message Describing Changes"
/wallflower-atto $ git push heroku master
```
